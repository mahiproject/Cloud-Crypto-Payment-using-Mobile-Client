What is Cloud Payment Cryptography?
CLOUD Payment Cryptography is a managed CLOUD service that provides access to cryptographic functions and key management used in payment processing in accordance with payment card industry (PCI) standards without the need for you to procure dedicated payment HSM instances. CLOUD Payment Cryptography provides customers performing payment functions such as acquirers, payment facilitators, networks, switches, processors, and banks with the ability to move their payment cryptographic operations closer to applications in the cloud and minimize dependencies on auxiliary data centres or colocation facilities containing dedicated payment HSMs.
The service is designed to meet applicable industry rules including PCI PIN, PCI P2PE, and PCI DSS, and the service leverages hardware that it is PCI PTS HSM V3 and FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified. It is designed to support low latency and high levels of up-time and resilience. CLOUD Payment Cryptography is fully elastic and eliminates many of the operational requirements of on premises HSMs, such as the need to provision hardware, securely manage key material, and to maintain emergency backups in secure facilities. CLOUD Payment Cryptography also provides you with the option to share keys with your partners electronically, eliminating the need to share paper clear text components.
You can use the CLOUD Payment Cryptography Control Plane API to create and manage keys.

Cryptographic details
AWS Payment Cryptography provides a web interface to generate and manage cryptographic keys for payment transactions. AWS Payment Cryptography offers standard key management services and payment transaction cryptography and tools you can use for centralized management and auditing. This documentation provides a detailed description of the cryptographic operations you can use in AWS Payment Cryptography to assist you in evaluating the features offered by the service.
AWS Payment Cryptography contains multiple interfaces (including a RESTful API, through the AWS CLI, AWS SDK and the AWS Management Console) to request cryptographic operations of a distributed fleet of PCI PTS HSM-validated hardware security modules.

AWS Payment Cryptography is a tiered service consisting of web-facing AWS Payment Cryptography hosts and a tier of HSMs. The grouping of these tiered hosts forms the AWS Payment Cryptography stack. All requests to AWS Payment Cryptography must be made over the Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS) and terminate on an AWS Payment Cryptography host. The service hosts only allow TLS with a cipher suite that provides perfect forward secrecy. The service authenticates and authorizes your requests using the same credential and policy mechanisms of IAM that are available for all other AWS API operations.
AWS Payment Cryptography servers connect to the underlying HSM via a private, non-virtual network. Connections between service components and HSM are secured with mutual TLS (mTLS) for authentication and encryption.

Design goals
AWS Payment Cryptography is designed to meet the following requirements:
•	Low-latency and high throughput — AWS Payment Cryptography provides cryptographic operations at latency and throughput level suitable for managing payment cryptographic keys and processing payment transactions.

•	Durability — The durability of cryptographic keys is designed to be equal that of the highest durability services in AWS. A single cryptographic key can be shared with a payment terminal, EMV chip card, or other secure cryptographic device (SCD) that is in use for many years.

•	Elastic — AWS Payment Cryptography scales out and in according to your demand. Instead of predicting and reserving HSM capacity, AWS Payment Cryptography provides payment cryptography on-demand. AWS Payment Cryptography takes responsibility for maintaining the security and compliance of HSM to provide sufficient capacity to meet customer’s peak demand.

**Key hierarchy
**The AWS Payment Cryptography key hierarchy ensures that keys are always protected by keys as strong as or stronger than the keys they protect.
